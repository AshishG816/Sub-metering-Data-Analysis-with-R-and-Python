# Sub-metering-Data-Analysis-with-R-and-Python
Working Through the Same Data Analysis Path Using Both R and Python

Hello, 

This is a work in progress. I am new to Github and creating R Notebooks. I have spent time working with R and just completed an R notebook of a project I did for a certification from Rutgers University in Data Analytics/Big Data. Information about the project is below as well as the beginning of each notebook. I am now excited to redo the project by diving into Python. My rationale is this is a great learning experience motivating me to dive into using Python and Jupyter Notebook. My goal is for this repo to be a good representation in the duality of data analytics using two different method to achieve the same/similar results.

Thank you,
Ashish

Sub-metering with Data Analytics
Dataset:
Measurement of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years that can be found on:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption

Task: 
Given over 2 million minutes of continuous electric power comsumption, can we make a case for the cost of installing sub-metering in an apartment complex?

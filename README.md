# Sub-metering-Data-Analysis-with-R-and-Python
Working Through the Same Data Analysis Path Using Both R and Python

Hello, 

This is a work in progress. I am new to Github and creating R Notebooks. I have spent time working with R and formally wrote an R notebook of a project I did for a certification from Rutgers University in Data Analytics/Big Data. I am now excited to redo the project by diving into Python. My rationale is this is a great learning experience motivating me to dive into using Python and Jupyter Notebook. My goal it is a good representation in the duality of data analytics using two different method to achieve the same/similar results.

Thank you,
Ashish

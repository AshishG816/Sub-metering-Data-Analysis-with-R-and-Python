# Sub-metering-Data-Analysis-with-R-and-Python
Working Through the Same Data Analysis Path Using Both R and Python

Hello, 
This is a work in progress. I am new to Github and creating R Notebooks. I have spent time working with R and am now formally writing an R notebook of a project I did for a certification. I am excited to now try and dive into Python and thought it would be a great learning experience to redo the project using Python and Jyputer Notebook. 

Thank you,
Ashish
